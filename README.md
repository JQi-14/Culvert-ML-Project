# Culvert-ML-Project
This is the folder for ease of sharing of data and python codes.<br/>
***
To load the data here on Jupyter, use the **raw** form of the data as shown in the figure below.<br/>

Example codes:<br/>
*read raw data in Github*<br/>
data=pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JQi-14/Culvert-ML-Project/main/686_full_data_raw_03_21_22.csv')<br/>

The difference between the two <code>csv</code> files is that one contains un-transformed raw data, the other has all values scaled by the maxmin method.
